# ðŸ“Š LA 311 Requests Dashboard

## About Me  
Hi, Iâ€™m Logan Thomas â€” a data enthusiast and aspiring data analyst.  
This project highlights my end-to-end workflow: starting from raw public data, building a SQL-based ETL pipeline, and finishing with a polished Excel dashboard for insights.

## Project Overview  
This project explores **311 requests in Los Angeles in 2023 and 2024** to uncover trends in service requests.
The workflow followed a **Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold pipeline** approach:  

1. **Data Acquisition**  
   - Downloaded raw 311 service request data from [2024](https://data.lacity.org/City-Infrastructure-Service-Requests/MyLA311-Service-Request-Data-2024/b7dx-7gc3/about_data) and [2023](https://data.lacity.org/City-Infrastructure-Service-Requests/MyLA311-Service-Request-Data-2023/4a4x-mna2/about_data) from Data LA.  
   - Imported into SQL Server for structured processing.  

2. **Data Cleaning (Bronze â†’ Silver)**  
   - Standardized data and fixed data types.  
   - Handled null values and inconsistencies.  

3. **Data Preparation (Silver â†’ Gold)**  
   - Aggregated requests by key metrics.  
   - Exported a clean, analysis-ready CSV.  

4. **Analysis & Visualization in Excel**  
   - Used **Power Pivot** to build a calendar table and relationships.  
   - Created PivotCharts and KPIs for year-over-year comparisons.  
   - Designed a final dashboard.

## Exploring the Data (Visuals) 

Once I had a cleaned CSV, I imported the final product into Excel and started exploring the data, utilizing Pivot Tables to find interesting trends.

Then I began visualizing the data with Pivot Charts.

- **Line Chart** â€” Monthly 311 request volume (2023 vs 2024)

Next, it was time to create KPI cards that call out key metrics in the data

Finally, I combined all of the elements into a single dashboard.
